    <hr><br>
    <p>I thoroughly enjoyed the class. I originally took it as a bird course, but the content includes more than just front-end developing. The course mostly focused on networks, backend servers, REST servers, asynchronous loading etc. There was no coding on the final - all technical questions. </p>
    <p>The course load included mini assignments, no mid and a final project worth 30%. The minis were easy, but some were just tedious (ex. recreating an exact webpage layout). The final project was done in groups of 3 or 4 and was marked individually. I recommend to avoid using fancier front-end frameworks for the project because its honestly waste. Nevertheless, use whatever that suits your course load.</p>
